# React Hooks

1. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
2. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
3. React provides a few built-in Hooks like `useState`.

### Ex: Simple Todo

Download the code and in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
